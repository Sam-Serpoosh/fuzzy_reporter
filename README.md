##Fuzzy Repoter

This is a simple reporter program which let you know if an event started but never finished!

It's based on `Play by Play` screencast from Peep Code that Corey Haines and Aaron Patterson did! You can find it [here](https://peepcode.com/products/play-by-play-aaroncorey) if you're intersted!

I thought that's an interesting program to write just for fun! So I did my own version of it which of course has some commonalities with what they did! (Specially the fornot end which is a `VERY BASIC sinatra`)
